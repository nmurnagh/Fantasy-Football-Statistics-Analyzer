# Fantasy-Football-Statistics-Analyzer
This program was created to analyze fantasy football statistics. It calculates fantasy points from the base stats so a user can modify the scoring settings for custom leagues. It also calculates situational statistics for each of the positions. This statistic compares how well the player preformed against the defense by comparing the points scored to the average points allowed to the position by the defense. Additional information about and individual player can be accessed by right clicking on a players name in the table and selected addtional information. 

Upcoming updates will add:
- Average and standard deviation for fantasy points per week for each of the players
- Ability to save scoring preferences
