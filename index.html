<p>This program was created to analyze fantasy football statistics from the previous season.  It fully supports custom league scoring settings, the scoring settings can be modified through the preferences toolbar and opening the scoring dialog. All values in the program update upon saving the scoring preferences. </p>

<p>The first tab is the fantasy points broken down by week, at the end is the total, average and standard deviation for the season. The average and standard deviation only includes the games that the player participated in. </p>

<p>The remaining situational points tabs are separated by position. The situational stats are a metric that compares how well the player performed against the defense in relation to other players at the position. It is a rating between 0-100 that compares their performance that week to the average amount of points the defense allowed to that position over the season. </p>

<p>Additional information about individual players can be accessed by clicking on the players name and selecting additional information. This will open a dialog that contains their season statistics as well as a bar graph comparing fantasy points scored to the average amount allowed by the defense for each week of the season. </p>
